    <p>This is by far my favorite recipe to make and dish to eat. I love it because the burgers are <b>bursting</b> with so
         much flavor in the end. The teriyaki sauce<br> 
         is the perfect pairing for the sweet pineapples on top. The jalapenos are a nice spicy suprise but not over powering.
         This is quick and easy dish with<br> 
         minimal prep and cook time which is great especially if you don't want to be in the kitchen that long. 
         These sliders are great for game days, a family gatherings,<br> 
         parties, or any occasion really.
